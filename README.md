# TodoListRemake with Node
Simple Todo list api, with a react front end.

Hello, if you would like to see this in action clone it.
Make sure you have node installed on your OS then run the command npm i inside the same directory as package.json.
Once you've done so you should have installed the node_modules and need to run the command Node index.js,
The port is set to localhost:3000 by default. Have fun with the api and do whatever you'd like from there!
